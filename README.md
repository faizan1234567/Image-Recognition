# Image-Recognition
This repository contains code for image classification of images, this repo uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/). 

It's easier for humans to recognize images, different objects, what's in the image. However, it's not that simple for computers. A computer does not understand images, drawings,s, etc, in fact, it understands numbers. Therefore, each image represents arrays of numbers called [pixelsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel). 

AI has brought change, with using AI computers can recognize what's in the image, differnt classes of an image. Thanks to AI, computers are good at computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, product recommendation, etc.

Image recognition is one such application of AI. With the rise of deep learning and the huge amount of data, it made it easier for computers to recognize images, classes of images, etc. For instance, if a deep learning model is trained on cats and dogs images, it will be identify whether it's a cat or dog when it will see a new image, [more here](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/image-recognition-neural-networks-use-cases).

Image classification has many applications mainly, digits recognition, medical imaging classification, differentiation between different classes, and many more. In this repository, different image classification deep learning models have been used. Which demonstrate advanced concepts such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and hyperparameter selection. Some models have been trained with and without data augmentation and transfer learning to show the difference. The models have achieved higher accuracies and lower losses when used with data augmentation and transfer learning.
